## Objective

Design an interactive game that uses an existing API for to save user game data and a leader board.
The project should run in a CLI, deployed via Heroku, using Python.

***The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely
for the purpose of completing this project.***

## Brief

### Hotdog Empire Tycoon

The goal of this site is to provide an interactive game where the user / player can compete for a place on the leader board. The final product should:

- be programmatically error free,
- be written using Python,
- have replayability,
- handle all user input errors gracefully and appropriately,
- give clear instructions regarding use and valid inputs.

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design

Some example user stories which will affect the design

#### First Time User

> *"As a person who like likes to play games, I would like something that provides some challenges but not overly difficult to learn."*
>
> *"As a competitive player, I would like to know how I compare with other users and go for top of a leader board."*
>
> *"As someone unfamiliar with tycoon game concept, I would like something that is to pick up and provides adequate direction."*

### Returning User

> *"As a returning user, I would like to see a list of current high-scores."*
>
> *"I would like to be able to continue a game where I left off."*
>
> *"I would the experience to be different each time I play."*

#### Interested Party

> *"As someone interested in how the application has been made, I am interested to see how user inputs have been validated and errors have been handled"*
>
>*"As someone interested in how the application wasm, I am interested to see any interesting code you made have used or created."*
