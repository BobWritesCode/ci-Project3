Background
------------------------------------

You have hit some really hard times lately and nearly lost everything.
Your down to your last Â£{STARTING_CASH}. Luckily your friend has told
you about a sure way to earn some quick cash... HOTDOGS!
He has told you where you can do to buy your first hotdog cart and
where you can set up for cheap. Everything else though is up to you.

You make your way down to the local hotdog supplies market and have a
look around. Most of what you see is outside your budget but see there
are a few things around to get you started....
